# SortingTechniques

All sorting techniques, implemented in Java language.

Also, applied Strategy Design patterns to decide sorting alogorithm at runtime.

Input: Integer array (Unsorted) & Type of sorting algorithm.

Output: Sorted Array

This will provide time & space complexity of each algorithm. Later on i will provide total time taken to each alogorithm to sort array for each techniques.
